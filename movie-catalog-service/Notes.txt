# Analogy for difference between Sync and Async
Sync and Async are like in the post office.
Sync - When you go to take your package you wait inline till your number comes and
then you are served (wasting time and stopping all your daily tasks).

Async -  you get your number via SMS and you keep with the rest of the
day and when your turn arrives you get a message on your phone to come
and get your package.
